                          CoRAL API Discovery
                 draft-fhj-core-coral-api-disco-latest

Abstract

   A common problem when exchanging CoRAL [I-D.ietf-core-coral]
   documents is aligning producing and consuming endpoints with regards
   to the vocabulary and the associated compression dictionary used.
   This memo proposes a set of mechanisms to allow advertising,
   discovery and negotiation of such translation artifacts.

1.  Introduction

   A common problem when exchanging CoRAL [I-D.ietf-core-coral]
   documents is aligning the producing and consuming endpoints with
   regards to the vocabulary and the associated compression dictionary
   used both in abstract and on the wire.

   For example, entities that consume CoRE problem details
   [I-D.ietf-core-problem-details] will typically need to understand the
   semantic associated with the compressed elements (in particular, the
   problem type code) in order to make sense of the received document.

   This memo proposes data formats and protocol interactions that allow:

   *  Producing endpoints to advertise a vocabulary used when
      interacting with a certain resource (Section 3.1);

   *  Consuming endpoints to discover the above (Section 3.2);

   *  Producers and consumers to negotiate its use in the context of a
      certain interaction (Section 3.3).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
